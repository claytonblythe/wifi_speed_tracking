# Tracking wifi speeds

Background: I was finding myself disappointed and frustrated with the speed of the wifi at my university. So I used a terminal client called speed-test cli 
that allows you to test your wifi speed from the command line. I then piped this result to a wireless speed log file in text form. Finally, I automated
this process with a crontab command, and created a python file to clean the wireless speed log file and plot it in matplotlib. Below is an example of the
result.
